# Apartment Affordability Calculator

Decription:
My program asks users for their financial information and prospective financial information.
This is catered towards students like myself so it calculates when I can move out if I don't have enough money for the first month.
Then it asks to what year I wanted to simulate my finances until, my graduation date and prospective salary upon graduating to show a graph and stats at the end for users to analyze if it is actually reasonable to move out right now.

     date formatting and date comparisons - datetime, dateutil

     Data analysis and modeling - matplotlib, numpy, pandas

As of 03/11/2022,
I need to add the option to have multiple renters that can each have unique data that we'll have to work with:
ex.) 
     
     different graduation dates ==> staggered salaries
     
     different pay period ==> perhaps will need to implement multi-threading (that'll be a ride!)
     

     add more visuals, write the stats to a csv/txt file for easier viewing
     -add a function that automatically runs the program if the user has a csv/txt file already (cuts down redundancy for the user)
